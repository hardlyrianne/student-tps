üìñ Description / Overview
The Student Transaction Processing System (TPS) is a comprehensive web-based application built using the Laravel MVC framework. This system manages student academic records, course catalogs, and enrollment transactions efficiently. It provides a complete solution for educational institutions to handle student information, course management, and enrollment processing with an intuitive user interface.

The system implements full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations across all modules and utilizes Laravel's Eloquent ORM for seamless database relationships between students, courses, and enrollments.

üéØ Objectives
The main objectives of this project are:

Implement MVC Architecture: Utilize Laravel's Model-View-Controller pattern for organized and maintainable code
Master CRUD Operations: Demonstrate complete Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionality
Database Relationships: Implement and showcase Eloquent relationships (One-to-Many, Many-to-Many)
User Interface Design: Create an intuitive and responsive interface using Bootstrap 5
Data Validation: Implement robust server-side validation for data integrity
Business Logic: Enforce business rules (e.g., prevent duplicate enrollments, require grades for completion)
Transaction Management: Process student enrollment transactions efficiently

Student Model with Relationships
php
<?php

namespace App\Models;

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class Student extends Model
{
    protected $fillable = [
        'student_id', 'first_name', 'last_name', 'email', 
        'phone', 'date_of_birth', 'address', 'status'
    ];

    // One-to-Many: Student has many enrollments
    public function enrollments()
    {
        return $this->hasMany(Enrollment::class);
    }

    // Many-to-Many: Student belongs to many courses
    public function courses()
    {
        return $this->belongsToMany(Course::class, 'enrollments')
                    ->withPivot('enrollment_date', 'grade', 'status')
                    ->withTimestamps();
    }

    // Accessor for full name
    public function getFullNameAttribute()
    {
        return $this->first_name . ' ' . $this->last_name;
    }
}
Enrollment Validation Logic
php
public function store(Request $request)
{
    // Check for duplicate active enrollment
    if (Enrollment::isStudentAlreadyEnrolled($validated['student_id'], $validated['course_id'])) {
        return back()->withErrors([
            'enrollment_error' => "Student is already enrolled in this course."
        ])->withInput();
    }

    // Check for completed course
    if (Enrollment::hasStudentCompletedCourse($validated['student_id'], $validated['course_id'])) {
        return back()->withErrors([
            'enrollment_error' => "Student has already completed this course."
        ])->withInput();
    }

    Enrollment::create($validated);
    return redirect()->route('enrollments.index')->with('success', 'Enrollment created!');
}
Database Migration - Enrollments Table
php
Schema::create('enrollments', function (Blueprint $table) {
    $table->id();
    $table->foreignId('student_id')->constrained()->onDelete('cascade');
    $table->foreignId('course_id')->constrained()->onDelete('cascade');
    $table->date('enrollment_date');
    $table->decimal('grade', 5, 2)->nullable();
    $table->enum('status', ['enrolled', 'completed', 'dropped']);
    $table->timestamps();
});
